# Real Case Examples
Everything you'll find here is neither scientific research nor advanced programming techniques. It's useful and simple, at least for me it was.

**ABECEB** and **Taranto** are both places where I worked, and none of them used Python as its main souce to generate insights or key points to help in decision-making. But still it became handy when trying to manipulate vast volumes of data—difficult to handle on a regular machine with Excel—as in ABECEB, or provide valuable info with little effort as in Taranto.

All sensible data has been pseudonymized, unless it comes from public official sources, like INDEC, just to name something commom.

**PS:**
In the case of Taranto, the most recent version of 'VCUs_alerts' is not the one shown here, but I'll soon update it. Its goal is to generate an automatic Excel comparing the Variable Cost per Unit of a range of products in different periods—with the time lapse in which the variations in production cost and/or production time took place—, and send that Excel attached to the right people in an also self-generated email. So far the Excel is done (again, not the one shown here), but I'm still working on the email part, whether I shall do it with Python or Power Automate.

I'll try to make a .exe program or something with a GUI out of this, once the email part is done.
